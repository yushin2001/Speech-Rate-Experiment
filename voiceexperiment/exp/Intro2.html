    <p>This task consists of 24 rounds. In each round, you will be choosing between “receiving 100 dollars today” and “receiving y dollars in x weeks” where x is positive, and y is greater than 100. That is, you will decide whether you are willing to wait for a couple of weeks to receive an amount larger than 100 dollars. Note that x and y will be assigned different values in every round. Please read and listen carefully. </p>
