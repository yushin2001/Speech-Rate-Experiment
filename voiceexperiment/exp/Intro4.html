    <h2>How your earnings are determined</h2>
    <p>After you finish making your decisions in all 24 rounds, one round will be randomly selected for payment. The amount and the timing of your payment will depend on the option you have chosen in this randomly selected round.</p>
    <h2>How your earnings are paid</h2>
    <p>Your earnings will be paid to you through wire transfer. If your payment date is in a few weeks, we will schedule the money to be wired to you on this future date. If your payment date is today, we will schedule the money to be wired to you today. The guaranteed $100 participation fee will be paid to you in cash right after the session.</p>
